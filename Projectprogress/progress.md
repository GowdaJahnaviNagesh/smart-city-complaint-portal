Project Title:
Smart City Complaint & Feedback Portal 

Problem Statement:
A Salesforce-powered portal enabling citizens to report civic issues, track complaint resolution with SLAs, and provide feedback. City admins gain real-time dashboards to monitor performance, improve accountability, and deliver better public services.

Phase 1:
Problem Understanding and Industry Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering
 Goal: Understand what each stakeholder needs from the system.
•	Citizens: Simple way to raise complaints (roads, water, electricity, etc.), track complaint status, provide feedback.
•	Departments (Road, Water, Electricity, etc.): Auto-assigned complaints, SLA tracking, workload visibility.
•	City Administrators: Monitor all complaints, view reports, analyze SLA breaches, improve transparency.
•	Government/Public Representatives: Access to high-level dashboards to identify recurring issues in wards/areas.

2. Stakeholder Analysis
 Goal: Identify roles and responsibilities in the ecosystem.
Primary Stakeholders
•	Citizens → End users submitting complaints & feedback.
•	Department Officers → Assigned to resolve complaints.
•	City Administrators → Monitor progress, handle escalations.
Secondary Stakeholders
•	Government Representatives → Use dashboards for planning.
•	IT/Salesforce Admins → Maintain system, handle automation.

3. Business Process Mapping
Goal: Map current challenges vs. Salesforce improvements.
Current Process (Manual/Traditional):
•	Citizens raise complaints via phone/email or physically visit offices → delays & lack of tracking.
•	Departments receive issues randomly, often without SLA enforcement.
•	Citizens rarely know if/when their issue will be resolved.
Proposed Process (Salesforce Enabled):
•	Citizens raise complaints through Salesforce portal/mobile → auto-assigned to correct department.
•	SLA timers ensure timely resolution, with escalation if breached.
•	Citizens can log in and track complaint status in real time.
•	Feedback captured via gamified rating system → helps improve services.

4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Goal: Benchmark against civic-tech and e-governance best practices.
•	Transparency: In many cities, citizens struggle with opaque complaint processes. Salesforce enables dashboards for visibility.
•	Accountability: SLAs + escalation ensure departments are responsible.
•	Citizen Engagement: Feedback & ratings improve trust in governance.
•	Scalability: The system can later extend to waste management, street lights, and emergency services.

5. AppExchange Exploration
Goal: Explore reusable Salesforce apps to reduce development effort.
•	Case Management apps (for service automation).
•	Citizen Service Portals (templates for public-facing portals).
•	SLA & Escalation apps (for timers and breach alerts).
•	Survey/Feedback apps (to capture citizen satisfaction).
